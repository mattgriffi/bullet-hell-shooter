# Bullet Hell Shooter

This is a 2D boss-rush bullet-hell shooter. It features 3 unique bosses, each with 4 unique and challenging phases. It has local high scores, upgrades, customizable controls, and more.

I created this game as my final project for ECE102 Intro to Engineering Problem Solving. My professor said that we could make anything we wanted, and this professor was known for giving extra credit for flashy projects. For a computer science major, what could be flashier than a video game? Thus, this project was born (over the course of a 4 month semester).

This project holds a special place in my heart because of what it represents. When I started this project, I had only taken one CS class, Intro to Computer Science. This was my first real project. I did not know Python, and I did not know how to make a video game. All I had was some fundamental knowledge, and a vision. Despite my lack of skills, I was able to make my vision a reality. The game as you see it here is exactly what I envisioned at the outset.
