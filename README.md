# Bullet Hell Shooter

This is a 2D boss-rush bullet-hell shooter. It features 3 unique bosses, each with 4 unique and challenging phases. It has local high scores, upgrades, customizable controls, and more.

I created this game as my final project for ECE102 Intro to Engineering Problem Solving in Fall of 2016. My professor said that we could make anything we wanted, and this professor was known for giving extra credit for flashy projects. For a computer science major, what could be flashier than a video game? Thus, this project was born (over the course of a 4 month semester).

This project holds a special place in my heart because of what it represents. This was my first real project. When I started this project, I had only taken one CS class, Intro to Computer Science. I did not know Python, and I did not know how to make a video game. All I had was some fundamental knowledge, and a vision. Despite my lack of skills, I was able to make my vision a reality. The game as you see it here is exactly what I envisioned at the outset.

## Usage

To use this program, simply run it like any other Python program:

```sh
python main.py
```

## Installation

This program requires Python 3.

The required 3rd party module (pygame) is listed in requirements.txt and can be installed with the following command:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Reflection/Postmortem

This game was my first real project. I was able to accomplish exactly what I set out to do without compromise. However, since I honestly had no idea what I was doing and had to figure everything out along the way, the code is utter trash. Some of the code in this project still gives me a headache when I look back on it, and I don't want to touch it with a 10 foot pole. So, instead of rewriting this project from scratch to make it pretty, I have chosen to preserve the code in all of its original beginner-level glory, and instead write a reflection. This reflection will go through the code file-by-file, method-by-method, and describe how I would do it differently if I were to tackle the same project today, 1 year later.
